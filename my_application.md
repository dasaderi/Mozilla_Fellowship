Last September, Sam Hindle and I founded PREreview (prereview.org), an open platform and community to facilitate the collaborative 
writing of preprint reviews at journal clubs (JCs). PREreview makes it easier for scientists around the world to run preprint JCs, 
develop their skills as reviewers, and share the fruits of their discussions openly. JCs are a staple in academia: they facilitate 
scientists collective engagement with others’ discoveries, and provide early-career researchers (ECRs) with a forum to learn how to 
critically evaluate research. However, the results of those discussions rarely leave the meeting rooms, and do not contribute to 
improving published scientific articles. Discussing preprints at JCs and sharing the feedback benefits not only JC participants, 
but also preprint authors, who have the opportunity to incorporate comments in their final publication. The wider community also 
benefits, as the released content adds to the value of the scientific discussion and opens new avenues for collaboration.
I want PREreview to be more than a space for publishing preprint reviews. I want to develop PREreview as a tool to drive broader and 
much needed cultural change in the ways science is evaluated and disseminated. 
In its most common form, peer review is conducted immediately prior to publication by a handful of unpaid and anonymous reviewers. 
They decide the soundness of the science in private settings, with waiting periods from submission to publication of six months or more. 
Reviewers are selected opaquely, by private entities, and through personal connections. ECRs, women, and scientists from underrepresented 
communities are disadvantaged during both the publication and review process. They are neither asked to contribute to peer review, nor is 
their work evaluated by inclusive and diverse reviewers. Finally, and paradoxically, while peer review is an important component of being 
a scientist, very few of us receive any training in it.
I envision PREreview as a hub to support and nurture the growth of a community that openly exchanges timely, constructive feedback on 
emerging scientific outputs. With the help and support of the Mozilla community, I plan to develop an interactive training program in 
peer review modeled after the Mozilla Open Leadership program – i.e., pairing mentors with mentees, running monthly community calls, and 
establishing digital journal clubs that engage and train ECRs across institutions. 
Part of the focus of this fellowship will be coordinating the development of a new open source website architecture to maximize PREreview
interoperability with existing platforms and tools (e.g., eLife, PLOS, bioRxiv, Hypothesis, Altmetric), and to establish a user experience 
that is in line with our community goals. For example, training and contributions will be automatically added to researchers’ ORCiD 
profiles. This feature will provide an easy way for researchers to list their experience with scientific evaluation in their CVs, and 
for journal editors to access a new, more diverse pool of reviewers who have openly demonstrated the quality of their contributions. 
Born from an idea sparked during a Mozilla miniWOW, PREreview has grown entwined and supported by the community Mozilla has built. 
This fellowship would allow me to focus my time and effort to move this project forward in the context of a global, interdisciplinary 
community with teamwork and collaboration at heart.

## What do you consider to be the biggest threat to the open web in your area of expertise? Why? In what way would the Internet
or the world be different if this threat were mitigated? (1000 char)

I believe the biggest threat to the open web and knowledge is consolidation, where a few powerful entities are able to influence what 
everyone knows and discovers. Even though the Internet has enabled an unprecedented democratization of knowledge, it is mostly built 
by (and for) the global North, in particular by the white, straight, cis male population. The same pattern applies to scientific 
research and its output. PREreview addresses the problems caused by the centralization of scientific evaluation by taking it from 
the hands of a homogeneous group of reviewers selected by commercial publishers, and giving it back to the whole scientific community, 
including the more diverse and often unheard voices of early-career scientists. This change alone would lead to a democratization of 
science and bring more innovative and, importantly, more targeted solutions to the problems of tomorrow.

## Why are you the right candidate for 10 months of self-directed study? Describe your current professional arrangement. (1000 char)

I am a neuroscientist with a passion for improving the scientific ecosystem by creating a more open and communal way of doing research. 
Since the beginning of the PREreview project, I have worked relentlessly to realize my desire to see preprints adopted and valued by other
scientists. In less than a year, PREreview has grown from having a few Google docs worth of resources, to having a platform and 
significant community engagement, with more than 20 groups committed to run preprint journal clubs and test our materials, 
70 PREreview members, and 680 Twitter followers. We have attracted interest from key stakeholders in the open ecosystem, including 
eLIFE, bioRxiv, and ASAPbio, as well as funders like the Sloan Foundation. I am fortunate for the incredible support of my research 
advisor, Stephen David, who not only applauds open practices but also leads open-source projects, and Robin Champieux, my champion 
open science mentor who inspired and encouraged me at every step of my training.

## What are two projects (with URLs) that you are proud of? What did you do on them and why are you proud? (2000 char)

I am proud of a recent effort inspired by my commitment to solve a problem that went long unaddressed at my institution: a 
lack of computer science training for neuroscience students. Many faculty held the view that learning to code was an alternative career 
skill, as opposed to a tool for better and more reproducible science. I took the initiative to form and coordinate an interdisciplinary 
group of collaborators to develop and teach a new programming course, now offered annually for credit at OHSU. The course, taught by 
experts and enthusiasts of all levels (including students!), moved from basic syntax concepts to plotting and data visualization, with a 
focus on neuroscience data familiar to our learners. We shared our lectures and data openly on [GitHub](github.com/dasaderi/python_neurobootcamp), 
and used innovative tools, such as JupyterHub, to facilitate interactiveness with the materials. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, 
with 90% or more of the students reporting they will likely apply what learned to their own work and would like to follow up with a more 
in-depth class. We are now writing a grant in collaboration the University of Oregon to offer the course to a broader community of 
neuroscientists.
Another fantastic experience was contributing to the organization of [Science Hack Day in Portland](portland.sciencehackday.org) 
in 2016 and 2017. Science Hack Day is a event that brings together science enthusiasts from different fields to build 
useful, creative, or simply fun things. It was inspiring to see participants of different ages and backgrounds work together to 
build a walking robot, design a geodesic dome, and making new friends while prototyping a CNC stereotactic drill for neurosurgeries! 
Events like this, aimed at demystifying science and encouraging collaboration, are the engines that power innovation and advance science 
in the context of a new culture of openness and transparency, and really demonstrate that science is for everyone!

## Is there anything else you’d like to share with us about yourself regarding the Fellowship? (700 char)

Mozilla offered me an example of how change can be achieved by empowering others to contribute their ideas and experiences. 
The many success stories born in this community give me the confidence that cultural change driven by grassroots efforts is not 
only possible, but is sustainable. With PREreview, I want to ensure community contributions continue to be at the core of our mission, 
because solutions created in the vacuum without targeted communities at heart might move fast, but rarely go far. Our fantastic advisory 
board, and a partnership with the organization Future of Research (futureofresearch.org) will help us craft our focus on ECRs and guide 
us in the process of securing funding.

## What research fields are you in? (200 char)

Systems neuroscience: my research combines in vivo electrophysiology, behavior, and computational modeling to understand how sound is 
processed in the dynamic brain.

## Describe your current research team. (200 char)
The David lab is a team of neuroscientists – 4 students, 3 postdocs, 3 research assistants – who work together on projects at the 
intersection of basic research, modeling, and open source software. 
Describe to us how open science advances your research. (700 char) 
Sharing protocols, datasets, source code and analyses together with the manuscript makes it so that the research output is more complete and reproducible. While I have not yet shared these myself, I plan to do so to accompany the publications that will come from my PhD work. Reading preprints and reviewing them at journal club have allowed me to not only learn about cutting edge research before everyone else, but also to make productive connections with scientists in my field – which in one case even led to a possible job interview for a postdoctoral position.

## List and explain briefly any projects you’re leading related to open science. (700 char)

* PREreview: platform for the collaborative writing of preprint reviews.
* Python for Neuroscientists: building on the material from the [neuro-bootcamp](github.com/dasaderi/python_neurobootcamp), the same group 
is creating a more complete educational resource.
* OpenCascadia 2019: together with Danielle Robinson and Robin Champieux, we are organizing a two-day local conference to build, highlight, 
and support communities and projects to make scholarship more open and inclusive.
* [Lab Code of Conducts](github.com/dasaderi/CoC_templates): this the very beginning of a project inspired by Mozilla and OpenCon; together 
with Glynis Mattheisen we are creating CoC templates for research laboratories.

## What project in the field do you find most inspiring to further science and the web? (350 char)

I am really inspired by the Whose Knowledge? (whoseknowledge.org) and OCSDNet (ocsdnet.org) initiatives because they challenge the 
meaning of open science in the context of global development, encouraging critical conversations and implementing solutions that meet 
the needs of communities that are too often forgotten by the global North.
