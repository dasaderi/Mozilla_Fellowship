# Mozilla_Fellowship
This repo contains my application to the Mozilla Fellowship for Science.

The application was successful, and I hope it will be helpful to anyone who is interested in appyling to this great Fellowship program. 

Applications for 2019/2020 cohort will open sometimes in March/April 2019. Please note that the questions will likely differ from those I was asked in April 2018.

If you have any questions or would like to learn more, please email me at daniela@mozillafoundation.org or DM me on Twitter @Neurosarda.

Good luck!
