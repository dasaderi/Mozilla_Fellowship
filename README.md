# My Mozilla Fellowship Application (Science Cohort 2018/2019)

🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊 Mozilla is awesome! 🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊

Hi! I'm Daniela and I'm a Neuroscientist and a Mozilla Fellow 2018/2019! When I applied, I had a lot of questions and friends who could answer them. I want to give back. So here is my application to the Mozilla Fellowship for Science 2018.

I hope it will be helpful to anyone who is interested in appyling to this great Fellowship program. 

Applications for 2019/2020 cohort will open sometimes in March/April 2019. Please note that the questions will likely differ from those I was asked in April 2018.

If you have any questions or would like to learn more, please email me at daniela@mozillafoundation.org or DM me on Twitter @Neurosarda.

Good luck!
